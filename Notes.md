See sources/Cathetosaurus diapophyseal and metapophyseal spurs - Jensen 1988 fig 9.jpg

ds = diapophyseal spurs
ms = metapophyseal spurs

These are 100% the traces of the transversospinal muscles, that is the exact course of the rotatores brevis. Nice to confirm that Jensen found them taking the same course that we suspected.

So, definitely a note - A NOTE I SAY - about these things being present in other sauropods. Maybe just using one of our dorso-lateral shots of D. carnegii from the second floor overlook for a figure. Oh, and a free plate from the 1918 Gray's anatomy to show what transversospinal muscles are, for all the civilians out there.

Here are some refs we'll need to check for the note:

* Jensen 1988 - we should actually read the relevant parts of the paper. Might not be a bad idea to use Google Scholar to see what papers have cited Jensen 1988, and see if any of them discuss transversospinal muscles in sauropods. The only one I can think of that might is:
* Schwarz-Wings et al 2007 on epaxial muscles in diplodocids; IIRC they discussed torso musculature a bit;
* Tsuihiji 2005 or 2007 on epaxial muscle homologies in extant diapsids; possibly he only covered longer, more superficial muscle groups but it will be worth a look.

That's all I can think of off the top of my head. I guess maybe have a quick scan through the classic monographs and see if anyone mentioned turtle plates on the sacrum. If  you think of anything else, let me know here.
