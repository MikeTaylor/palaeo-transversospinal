This respository contains work on an in-progress paper that will describe the attachment points for transversospinal muscles in the pelvis and dorsal column of sauropod dinosaurs.

I've written other open-process papers ([the Archbishop description](https://github.com/MikeTaylor/palaeo-archbishop/), [the vertebral orientation paper](https://github.com/MikeTaylor/palaeo-vo/)) in Markdown, so that they appear formatted on GitHub ([example](https://github.com/MikeTaylor/palaeo-vo/blob/master/vo-manuscript.md)). But that raises a collaboration barrier, so I'll do this one in LibreOffice.

Anyone is welcome to [file issues](https://github.com/MikeTaylor/palaeo-transversospinal/issues).
